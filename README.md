# Słoiki

An Android application based on a simple idea - if someone has toomuch of one type of food, he can exchange it with other people. All exchange offers in the area are presented on the map.

## What is it?

Do you have too many dumplings? In our application, you will exchange it for meatballs! In our app you can add "jars with food" to the map and say that you would like to exchange it for some other food.
All jars in the area are presented on the map or list. When you want to add new jar, just tap "+" button and select size and food type.
Users have their own accounts and collect points for good exchanges and tasty meals. 

### How it looks?
