# Słoiki

An Android app based on a simple idea of exchanging food.
It's a trade platform, where the only product and currency are so called "jars" (packaged food).


## What is it?

Do you have too many dumplings? In our application, you will exchange it for meatballs! In our app you can add "jars with food" that you want to exchange on a map and wait for other users from 
nearest location that will answer your offer with their own jars.
Of course if you're really hungry you can do the same and look for people who already posted their offers and choose the best one for you :)
Users collect points for successfull trades and tasty meals.

### How does it look?
